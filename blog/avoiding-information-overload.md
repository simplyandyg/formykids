My system is far from perfect so I’m always looking for suggestions, but here’s what I currently try do:

1. Avoid the “any benefit” approach, which is where you hold on to or do things because at some random point in the future, they may possibly provide a benefit.

2. Keep the information I consume mostly focused on the subject I’m learning

3. I unsubscribed from every email newsletter. If you are subscribed to something directly focused on what you’re learning, it may be okay. If you want to learn, your best bet is focused material.

4. Only read articles related to what I’m currently learning. I save related articles for future reading to a trello board for what I’m learning. Then I close out the browser tabs to avoid clutter and the urge to start reading articles before I’m finished with the current one. If I want to save an article for reference, I put it into Evernote or a Google doc

5. I have a book list in a Google spreadsheet for any and every book I may ever be interested in reading. Columns are: title, author, subject areas, year read, favorite (yes/no), Rating, notes

6. Videos I handle the same way I do articles. I try to only save any that relate to my current subject of focus – usually in a YouTube playlist or trello board

7. I used to answer all messages immediately. Now, I do my best to push them off to between or after “deep work” sessions. If the reply will take more than 5 minutes, I wait until I’m done with work for the day to send it. There are exceptions, such as work and family emergencies.

My big weakness right now is my separation of notes. I have some in Evernote, some in Google Docs, and even some shorthand notes in Google Keep…

I tend to use Evernote for random notes and saving reference articles.

Google Docs tends to be really focused notes and research for what I’m learning – similar to how college notes would look.

Google Keep tends to be quick notes like saving a shopping list or take out order for the family.

I also unfollowed almost half my Twitter feed to trim down on noise. Twitter tends to be the place that I do go to browse and somewhat break the rule of avoiding the “any benefit” approach. However, I do try to limit myself to less than 10 minutes a day there.

Also, being realistic, I’m not a machine. I have trouble sticking to this framework, but I try to get better every day. So far with this approach, I’m more productive than in the past.
