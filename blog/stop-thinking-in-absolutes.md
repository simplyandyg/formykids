Anything (blog, speech, class, test, etc) that lumps people into groups, especially based on something conceptual such as political party or by the way they think (intellectual vs simpleton or independent-minded vs conventional-minded) is an oversimplification of human complexity especially when it comes to the mind. That's not to say that there's not valuable information to be taken away from anything that separates people into groups. The point is more so to ensure that you Read it through the lens of avoiding absolutism. Very few things in life are absolute especially when it comes to humans and even more so when it comes to complexities of the mind. To define people in such simple boxes as do not realize the complexities of reality. Again, it does not mean that it doesn't have its place or it's usefulness. And it doesn't mean that it won't be accurate a certain percentage of the time because it will. For example that's exactly why many stereotypes seem accurate. But most stereotypes are also inaccurate a significant percentage of the time. And that's the point here. We need to keep an open mind about people and not place them to such simple boxes of which we do not think they will ever step outside the bounds of.
