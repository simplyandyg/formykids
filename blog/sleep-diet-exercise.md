Sleep. Eat clean. Exercise. If I had to put an order to their importance that would be it, despite exercise being my favorite.

Disclaimer:
I'm not a medical professional, dietician, or certified personal trainer. So none of this is medical advice. I'm just a guy who reads a lot, is constantly trying to improve myself and my life, and wants to leave a record of those learnings for his kids.

(Todo:

What how why for the intro

Get into why staying healthy is important. It's not only to avoid illness or living a long life. It's living with less pain and aggravation. Make you love slightly harder to avoid the truly difficult aspects of chronic illness)

## Summary:

**Sleep** 6 to 10 hours per night depending on your personal needs. Your bedtime and the amount of sleep should remain consistent - go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.

**Eat** **clean**. Avoid processed food.

**Exercise** 4-6 days per week. 20-60 minutes of moderate-intensity* exercise per session. _Almost_ any exercise is better than nothing. Consistency and proper form are the two most important things.

*Above I say to aim for moderate-intensity exercise. If you have not exercised for an extended period of time then you should start off slow. It is important to avoid injury. Beginning with low-intensity exercise allows your body time to adapt to exercise.

Benefits:

The benefits of doing those three things are innumerable. Regardless, I'll list some of the best ones. Sleeping well, eating well, and exercising can help you to:



* Improve immune function
* Reduce risk of many illnesses
* Reduce risk of chronic disease
* Reduce risk of some cancers
* Maintain a healthy heart
* Reduce risk of stroke
* Improve insulin sensitivity
* Reduce risk of type 2 diabetes
* Reduce risk of metabolic syndrome
* Reduce inflammation
* Improve gut health
* Improve bone strength
* Improve sexual health
* Improve skin health
* Improve odds of a long life
* Maintain a healthy weight
* Avoid eating extra calories
* Reduce stress
* Stabilize emotions
* Improve your mood
* Improve social interactions
* Improve mental health
* Improve your memory
* Think more clearly
* Focus better and for longer periods
* Improve productivity
* Improve learning
* Improve judgment
* Improve physical strength
* Improve energy levels
* And more...

The benefits of sleep, eating well, and exercise overlap, intertwine, and build on each other. Improved sleep and eating clean help exercise performance. Eating clean and exercise helps with better sleep, which then improves exercise performance. See what I mean?

Lacking in any of these categories can lead to serious health problems.

**If we aren’t trying to be elite athletes...**
We don’t need to train like elite athletes.
We don’t need to be the strongest.
We don’t need to be the fastest.
We don’t need to optimize every variable.

**What we do need:**
Stay healthy.
Avoid injury.
Enjoy life.

**How can we do it?**
Sleep.
Eat clean.
Follow a sustainable fitness plan.
Be consistent in the above.

It does not take as much time and effort to reap near optimal health and fitness results as many people think. You do not need to spend time optimizing every variable. More than anything else, optimal health requires consistency.

Most fitness gurus and influencers today sell athleticism and extremes, not health. You don't need to be the fastest, strongest, or sexiest to be healthy. You don't need to optimize every variable of your life to be healthy.

It's easy to get stuck in trying to squeeze out every ounce of physical performance. If your goal is to be a pro athlete, optimizing makes sense. It's overkill if you're simply aiming to be healthy.


## Sleep.


### What is proper sleep hygiene?

Proper sleep hygiene is consistent, uninterrupted, high-quality sleep of an appropriate length.


#### What is consistent sleep?

Sleep consistency has two main components: time of day and length of (preferably uninterrupted) sleep. That means going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Doing this will help in feeling refreshed as well as adding to the quality of your sleep. Yes, even on the weekends. Yes, people may very well think your commitment to consistent sleep is weird. So what?


#### What is uninterrupted sleep?

Uninterrupted sleep is sleeping without waking for an extended period of time. Everyone wakes up during a night of sleep. Whether it is to use the bathroom, adjust the blankets, or roll over. It is perfectly normal. It becomes an issue when you are unable to fall back to sleep in less than a few minutes. Or when you find yourself waking up more than a few times a night. This also ties in with sleep efficiency, which is the ratio of time sleep vs time spent laying in bed trying to sleep. You want to be at 85% or higher.

Of course, there will be times when it is not possible to avoid interruptions. But try to keep those times to a minimum and make uninterrupted, consistent sleep your norm.

The vast majority of people need between 6-10 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. That doesn't mean if you are a 10-hour per night person that 6 hours is enough for you. Each person is different. The key is learning what amount of sleep makes you feel best and sleeping uninterrupted for that length of time each night.


#### What is quality sleep?

Quality sleep is measure by whether you enter the appropriate sleep cycles for the amount of time that is expected for each cycle. Consistent, uninterrupted, and efficient sleep contribute heavily to sleep quality as they help ensure your body enters the necessary sleep cycles for the desired length of time.


### Why is proper sleep hygiene important?

At a minimum, a lack of quality sleep will undermine your efforts in diet and exercise.

A lack of sleep can lead to numerous short-term and long-term effects.

Possible short-term effects:

* Lack of alertness
* Slower reflexes
* Impaired memory
* Cognition issues
* Trouble controlling your mood
* Increased chances of a car accident
* Decreased muscle recovery
* Increased inflammation


Possible long-term effects:

* Weight gain
* Depression
* Anxiety
* Compromised immune system
* Decreased sex drive
* Balance issues
* High blood pressure
* Diabetes
* Heart failure
* Heart attack
* Stroke
* Worsening of other chronic issues


### How to implement proper sleep hygiene?

Start with improving your sleep quality. Once you work on that, you will be able to better gauge what length of sleep your body needs.

#### How to improve sleep quality?
Here are some things you can do to help improve sleep quality:

**Prep your sleep area**
* Play around with room temperature. Cooler is often better.
* Have a comfortable surface to sleep on.
* Use blackout curtains
* Remove all clock faces from the bedroom. Knowing what time it is doesn't benefit you. It often has a negative causes anxiety about how much time is left for sleep or how long you have been trying to fall asleep.
* Remove all light sources.
* Leave your phone out of the room or at least flip it over and put it on do not disturb. This prevents it from waking you, but also prevents the screen from being a light source.
* Place a pen and paper on your night stand to write down anything that may be keeping you up at night

**Develop a good pre-sleep routine**
You don't have to do all these things, but incorporating some may help you fall asleep faster and sleep better through the night.
* No screen time within the hour before bed
* Meditate
* Read from a physical book or e-reader designed for night time reading such as the Kindle Paperwhite
* Take a warm bath
* Drink tea
* Stretch
* Do some deep breathing
* Journal - write about your day, write a to-do list of anything running through your head that you're afraid to forget, write down anything making you anxious
* Consuming tart cherry or kiwi was shown in studies to potentially improve sleep
* Set an alarm or reminder 15-60 minutes before your bedtime to remind you to start your sleep routine and get ready for bed

**Day-time activities to help you sleep**
* Exercise.
* Try to keep your stress levels low.
* Go outside for 15-30 minutes after waking. Sunlight entering your eyes helps kick off your bodies wakefulness, which in turn starts your biological clock for when to wind down for sleep. Artificial sunlight doesn't do the trick.
* Don't consume caffeine within 10 hours of your bedtime.
* Don't drink alcohol - if you do, try to avoid it within 6 hours of your bed time.*
* Don't do drugs.*
* Avoid taking sleep medications if possible*. However, there are supplements and foods that are healthy and may help.

*Most drugs, including some sleep medications, have a negative impact on the quality of your sleep. Even if they help you fall asleep, the overall quality of sleep will not be as high.

#### How to determine your ideal amount of sleep?

**The best way** to determine your ideal amount of nightly sleep is to avoid setting an alarm for a couple of weeks. If you can do this, record when you laid down for sleep and what time you woke up. Use those times to determine your length of sleep. Then calculate how many hours you slept on average over the course of the two weeks. Now, decide what time you need to wake up in the morning. Use your average length of required sleep and your desired wake up time to determine when you should go to bed each night.

You can also add 15-30 minutes of buffer time to your average if you'd like. This will give you a better chance of waking up naturally, before your alarm rips you from sleep.

**Option 2:** If you can't avoid setting an alarm then experiment with different lengths of sleep. I suggest starting with a longer period of time such as 9-10 hours. To some, this amount may sound excessive, and to others it may sound like a dream or even an impossibility. This will be an experiment for only a couple weeks to find your ideal sleep length. Find a way to commit to the time and experiment. For many people, allowing 9-10 hours for sleep will have you naturally waking up in the morning before your alarm does off. Record when you laid down in bed and when you woke up for the day. Do this for two weeks. Calculate the average amount of sleep you needed to wake up naturally. From now on use this amount of sleep to determine what time you set your alarm for. 

As mentioned above, feel free to add 15-30 minutes of buffer time to help ensure you wake up naturally.

#### Last word on sleep
I understand this may seem excessive. I don't expect anyone to do it all. Not everyone needs it all. It's about being honest with yourself about your needs and finding what works for you.


(Breaking down eating is next after how to improve sleep quality)

## Eat Clean. Eat Well.

### What is clean eating?

### Why is clean eating important?

### How do I develop a clean eating lifestyle?

Crash diets are not what I mean by eating well. Everyone loves losing weight fast. Many people go back to unhealthy eating habits after a crash diet. This leaves you very likely to gain back the weight. Not to mention being at risk for any number of health problems.

Eating well is simpler than many make it sound. People tend to push fad diets. People tend to be fanatical about their lifestyle diets. I'm not saying fad diets don't work. I'm not saying lifestyle diets don't work. I'm saying it is possible to avoid being a zealot while maintaining healthy eating habits by following a few simple guidelines. The common denominator between different diet fanatics is to avoid processed foods. Eating whole, unprocessed foods is your guideline to lifelong healthy eating habits. I think vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, etc. are all fine as long as they are not processed.

If you struggle to lose weight or consistently find yourself feeling sick, nauseous, run-down, tired, dizzy, etc, you should seek out help from professionals. You may have a slight allergy to a food, which may only show up in you as lethargy and not a violent reaction. Consider finding including a doctor who specializes in diet-based medicine.

There is scientific evidence to support a food-based approach to many health issues. I have heard of diseases going into remission with eating better. Keep in mind, some people still need medical intervention no matter how clean and smart they eat.

Consider taking a quality multivitamin. Some people will argue healthy adults eating a healthy, balanced diet do not need one. They may be right. But if it isn't doing harm, why not hedge your bets? According to studies, a multivitamin may also have a positive effect on mental health. I specify a "quality" multivitamin for a reason. The government does not regulate the vitamin and supplement industry. Leading some companies to be inaccurate with the labels on their vitamin and supplement products. This is why you should choose a vitamin from a company you trust.

Why unprocessed, whole foods?

One reason, it is harder to overconsume calories when eating whole, unprocessed foods. By this I mean, snacking on strawberries instead of Oreos will likely lead to consuming fewer calories.

Another reason why the guideline of unprocessed, whole foods is great? The simplicity. It's pretty simple compared to the rules of some diets. I'm not saying it's easy to stick to, but simple and easy are two different things. The FDA requires nutrition labels, but they can be tricky to read. Sugar comes in many forms these days. A quick Google search will yield a massive list. There are also many kinds of oils out there. Some are perfectly healthy when eaten in moderation. Others, not so much. Moral of the story: it's much simple to stick with whole foods than to find healthy processed foods.

While added sugars and oils make processed foods tasty. They add a ton of extra and unnecessary calories. Not only your body is negatively affected by added sugars and oils. Your brain, your gut biome, and sleep are as well.

But fruits and vegetables contain sugar… So is it okay to consume them? There are people who argue it is not. For the diets of most people, I disagree. It's okay to consume fruits and vegetables. Here's a quote from a Harvard Health article on the topic:

"Natural and added sugars are metabolized the same way in our bodies. But for most people, consuming natural sugars in foods such as fruit is not linked to negative health effects, since the amount of sugar tends to be modest and is “packaged” with fiber and other healthful nutrients. On the other hand, our bodies do not need, or benefit from, eating added sugar."

[https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-certain-types-of-sugars-healthier-than-others-2019052916699](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-certain-types-of-sugars-healthier-than-others-2019052916699)

Keep in mind that added sugars, even if natural, are still not ideal. Eating 20 spoonfuls of honey is too much sugar.

Here's a couple more articles on processed and added sugars:

[https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar#:~:text=%22The%20effects%20of%20added%20sugar,Hu](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar#:~:text=%22The%20effects%20of%20added%20sugar,Hu).

[https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/features/how-sugar-affects-your-body](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/features/how-sugar-affects-your-body)

Also, alcohol is sugar. There are studies showing that moderate alcohol consumption may provide health benefits. There are also studies that show negative effects ranging from sleep problems to causal links of some cancers. The equivalent of one shot, one glass of one, or one bottle of beer a day may be okay, but more than that is probably not. And no, you can't average it out. By that I mean, binging on the weekends and not drinking during the week is not helping your case for being healthy.

I'm still doing more research on oils. It's a topic that is, as far as I know, hotly debated. It's hard to recommend one oil to use because different oils have different smoke points and work better for different types of cooking. However, the general consensus seems to be that vegetable oil is not a good choice. There's a lot of debate around seed oils and whether they should be part of a healthy diet. Olive oil (especially extra virgin, which is the least processed) seems to be generally considered the healthiest.

Earlier, I alluded to not having to worry about your macronutrient splits if you're eating a whole food diet. For most people, I do believe this is true. Is low-carb fine? Is low-fat fine? Yes. They are. Especially if they work for you and help you to eat well. The key is to avoid diets so strict that you decide to give up healthy eating and go back to eating junk.


## Exercise.

Sustainable fitness is what most people should be chasing. It doesn't sound sexy like "6 pack abs in 6 weeks" does, but it's also achievable and not a blatant clickbait lie.

The 3 most important things to remember when exercising are:



1. Proper form.
2. Take it slow.
3. Be consistent.

Proper form is the most important because it helps prevent setbacks due to injury.

Be patient. Taking your time to learn proper form and not worrying about ramping up workout intensity quickly will help prevent injuries, which means progress will be steady and consistent. This will lead to the results you are looking for in a way that won’t ruin your body.

What’s the best exercise plan? The one you will stick with, period. Making the habit stick is a lot more important than what exercises you’re doing. To this point, if you ever find yourself without any time to exercise or about to go to bed and you skipped exercise that day, do some push-ups or a plank. This will help reinforce the habit.


### I have trouble sticking with it? What should I do?

If you are not exercising at all right now, it's likely because you see it as this annoying, difficult, time-consuming thing. "Well I have to change, I have to drive to the gym, I don't know what I'm doing so it's embarrassing, other people look at me…" so on and so forth.

To get over a lot of those issues start with one minute a day. Every week add another minute. In six months you'll be doing 30 minutes a day.

The idea is simple. It's based on compounding and removing all barriers. If you can't spare a minute out of your day to do a plank or push-ups or march in place, you're either lying to yourself or you're the busiest person on earth. For just one minute of exercise, you won't work up a big sweat, so you don't have to shower after, you don't need special shoes or clothing, you don't need to go to the gym. All the excuses go out the window.

The most important thing is to build the habit. Try to do your one minute per day at the same time each day. Maybe right when you wake up or right before lunch. As the sessions increase in length, keeping the exercise at the same time every day will help to ensure you don't miss it one day because you didn't have time. You'll be used to saving that time block for it.

If you think there's no way this could work. Then just try it. What do you have to lose? One minute a day? Trust me, you likely lose a lot more than that on other useless things throughout the day.


### Before Selecting an Exercise Plan

Before starting an exercise routine do a self-assessment. Do you have any current ailments? Do you have a bum-knee? Do you have a bad back? Do you have excessively tight hips? For almost all of these things, I would recommend first consulting your primary care physician and asking if they recommend you start a beginner yoga or body flow class or something like GMB’s [Elements: A Foundation for Physical Autonomy](https://gmb.io/e/) (no, I’m not getting paid to put that there. I am actually taking the class as of January 2021).

They may recommend physical therapy instead of or alongside one of the things I mentioned. If so, do it. Some people don’t want to pay the money, which I understand. It can be expensive. But don’t we spend more on things that are not nearly as important as our health? Like the over-priced phone you’re likely reading this on? Taking care of your health is worth the money.


### My Exercise Recommendations

First and foremost, find a plan that you will enjoy and stick with.

I personally aim for 4-6 days a week of moderate or high-intensity exercise for 20-60 minutes per session. If you haven't worked out recently, start with 1 or 2 days per week and add in a day every other week until you reach your desired frequency. This way, you won't overdo it.

From what I've found through my reading and research, 2-3 days of cardio, 2-3 days of (preferably heavy) weight training, and 1 day of yoga or body flow is a great balance.

Always warm-up for at least 3-5 minutes before working out. Find a warm-up routine that works for you. I tend to do jump rope or jumping jacks, push-ups, and air squats.

Lifts to focus on are the squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead/military press, pull-ups and/or bent-over rows, dips, and some kind of heavy carry (farmer carries or suitcase carries). Again, form is so important. All of these lifts are incredibly effective at building strength and muscle. They can also be incredibly effective at destroying your body if you do them with incorrect form. Seek help from others. Whether you hire a professional coach or ask people from a community of experienced lifters such as [https://www.reddit.com/r/StartingStrength/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StartingStrength/)

You may not ever need accessory or isolation exercises. At the very least, you shouldn't think about them until you are proficient in the above lifts. Incorporate a de-load/rest week every 4-6 weeks assuming you are diligent with your training, otherwise you probably won't need one unless your body is feeling run down. Don't push too hard too fast. Focus on form and proper muscle contraction not on how much weight is on the bar. Both cardio and strength gains should be a marathon, not a sprint.

For running, don't increase total mileage per week by more than 10% at a time. Roughly every 4-6 weeks give yourself a rest by dropping the weekly mileage by ~25-30%. The next week you can bump up again by 10% on the mileage you were running prior to your rest week. Some runners also take about a month off from running every year. Some take the entire month off, some drop running frequency and mileage by 50+%, and/or switch to other forms of cardio at a reduced intensity.

Weight machines, HIIT training, circuit training, kettlebell workouts, and other forms of exercise aside from running are all more than acceptable. Find what works for you. I simply aim to give an easy and effective exercise framework. In whatever exercises you choose, if there is form to consider then learn proper form before increasing intensity. Increase workout difficulty at a conservative rate. It's not about being fit in a week, it's about being fit for life. It's about sustainable fitness.


#### A good place to start with training

Weight training program: 5x5 / Starting Strength ([there's a book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982522738/ref=cm_sw_r_sm_apa_glt_fabc_0A7FKFFTM9YCXKRTX9TP?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1))

Running: Run slow. So slow that you can have a conversation without gasping for air. For most people, that's probably between 10-13 min/mile. You don't need to run hard to build cardio endurance. Slowly build up distance.

If you haven't been exercising consistently then for the first couple of months, you may want to choose one style of exercise (cardio, HIIT, weight training, etc.) and aim to exercise every other day for a couple of months before doing back to back days. This will give your body time to properly recover and adjust to exercising while helping to avoid injury.

A lot of people will argue with running while doing the Starting Strength program because it is not designed to be done in accordance with any other exercise on the off days if I recall correctly. However, as I have said before, the goal is not to be the fastest or strongest. It is to stay in great shape. Fitness should be a marathon, not a sprint. So take your time. Rest when you’re feeling run down. Progress slower than you know you can and slower than the program recommends. You’ll be surprised at the results you’ll achieve even with slow but steady progress.

Other good weight training programs for beginners:

[https://legionathletics.com/strength-training-plan/](https://legionathletics.com/strength-training-plan/)

I'm not affiliated with Legion Athletics in any way. I simply think they have a lot of great material.

Running slow is important, but how slow? If you know your max heart rate or have a personal best 6k or marathon time, there’s a helpful chart here: [https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/beginners/a26514237/running-pacing-easy-miles/](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/beginners/a26514237/running-pacing-easy-miles/)

I didn’t know any of those things even years into my running, which makes “slow” even more subjective than it is from the charts in the link above. “Slow” should be a “conversational pace”, which means you’re running slow enough that you could carry on a conversation without gasping for air. This may feel uselessly slow to you, but it is not. Here’s a great article on easy running. It’s geared toward beginners, but anyone who isn’t currently doing 80% of their runs as easy runs should read it: [https://www.verywellfit.com/how-fast-should-i-run-2911126](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-fast-should-i-run-2911126)

Why do I only talk about weight training and running in my recommendations?

I’ve personally only really used weight training, running, and HIIT in my training. Most of the reading I’ve done has been around weight training and running. So those are the two I tend to focus on and recommend most. I also think they are easy to get into and provide great results.

Remember: It doesn’t matter what I recommend.  The best exercise plan is the one you enjoy and will stick with.


### Flexibility and Mobility

Stretching is incredibly important. I always neglected it, thinking that it didn't apply to me even though I always had extremely limited ranges of motion in almost every joint.

Now, I feel it's invaluable, and I feel much better and much less tight than when I was younger. Stretching is easy to overlook. It can be boring. But you don't have to stretch in silence. You don't have to stretch for an hour. Also, adding 15-30 minutes of easy yoga on your day off might be good for you, too.

A good way to start the habit is to pick one good stretch per area (i.e. ankles/calves, hips, hamstrings, glutes, arms, shoulders, back, etc) per day. If that still sounds overwhelming. Then start with one stretch per day. Personally, I recommend starting with a hip stretch, even something as simple as yoga’s “Child’s Pose”. Pick any stretch and make it a daily habit. After doing a single stretch a day for a few weeks, make it two stretches per day. And continue until you have a good routine of multiple stretches daily.

Check out the following links for some ideas:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVPyAU4l-sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVPyAU4l-sw)


### Rest and Recovery

As I mentioned earlier, taking time off to deload or do light recovery work is a necessity for longevity and avoiding injury.

If your body is feeling tired and you've been struggling through your workouts lately. Feel free to skip a workout or two or even take a full week off.

Here's a personal example I ran into: When training for a Spartan Ultra, at the peak I was running 40-50 miles per week and strength training twice a week. I built up to this from a sloppy routine in six months. Eventually, I found myself unable to deadlift my normal working set weight for even 3 reps. So what did I do? I lightened the weight and did higher reps. DO NOT do what I did.

Not until months later when reading more about overtraining and deloading did it click for me: I was overtrained. My body was tired. What I needed was a break; not more reps at a lower weight.

A good way to help recovery along and prevent joints from breaking down is to incorporate light and easy movement into your days. Whether that’s dancing around your living room with your spouse, friends, or children, doing yoga, body flow, or tai chi, or just taking some time to “shake it out”. Providing external movement for those tight and stiff internal joints helps to keep them healthy.


## Interconnectedness in the body

The best way to see long-term sustained results is to listen to your body. Too many people try to be a hero and work through the pain. If you're a pro-athlete maybe you have to, it may be part of the job, but you are probably not a pro athlete. Either way, pushing through the pain means risking further and even permanent injury, more recovery and rehab, spending more time on the sidelines, and losing more of your progress than if you listened to your body. Many people don't realize that pushing through an injury on one body part can lead to issues in other parts of the body. An injured ankle if not treated can lead to knee pain, hip pain, back pain, and more. If you're injured, it's best to take some time off to heal.

Sometimes, even working out, but avoiding putting direct stress on an injured body part is not helpful. Have you ever noticed sometimes when you're really straining, you squeeze almost all your muscles despite only directly working a few? This can be problematic when injured. So if you are going to work out healthy parts of your body when some are injured, try to be very conscious of which muscles you should not be using.

The body is very interconnected. It is essentially a complex ecosystem, and if anyone part is not functioning correctly, it can have compounding downstream effects.

Everything I wrote about above is important in avoiding a slew of health problems, building muscle, losing weight, and doing it in a sustainable fashion. If you're lacking in one of the three main categories (sleep, diet, and exercise) the other two will suffer, especially if it is over an extended period of time. Some people, especially young people, reading this may think they are an exception to the rule because currently, they might be able to get away with eating and drinking whatever they want, sleeping crazy hours, and ignoring their body's warning signs. However, it is not going to be sustainable in the long term. It is going to prevent them from seeing even better results in both the short and long term. I know we are not going for optimal results here, but we are trying to avoid suboptimal health, which requires sleep, eating well, exercise, and listening to your body.


## For the optimizers

If you insist on optimizing every variable, then at least avoid wasting time and money by focusing on the most important ones first. And to do that, you don't need fancy hardware or supplements to start. That means good sleep, exercising, and eating well. If you are not doing those three you should not be paying a lot of money for supplements or other things to optimize your health.
