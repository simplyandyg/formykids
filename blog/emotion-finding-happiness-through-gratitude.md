I'm writing a thread on this but it is essentially about why do we always have to pursue more for the sake of more. If we learn to be happy with what we have and where we are then that should leave us to pursue things that add to or maintain that happiness. Also make it clear that it is obviously okay to be unhappy. However myself personally prefers to keep those unhappy times as the minority. And maybe happiness is not even the right word, maybe the word is the feeling of content. Unhappy times aren't even important so that we don't begin to take the happy times or the times of contentment for granted.

The other thing I should be included is how to do this

The first way that I can think of right now is through mindfulness meditation practice and practicing gratitude through a daily gratitude journal.
