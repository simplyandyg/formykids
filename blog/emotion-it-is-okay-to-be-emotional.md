In today's society there's a huge focus on "staying positive". That's a great message. I think it's important to stay positive in respect to our general attitude towards everyday life. If you ask me, I think having a generally positive attitude is the way to live. You're more likely to be successful and forge good, lasting relationships. However, it's also completely okay to not stay positive sometimes.

Sometimes you have a downright bad day. Sometimes you lose someone you care about. Sometimes you are under so much stress you simply want to break down and cry. And you should. Just let it happen. It does not make you weak. It doesn't mean you're a pessimist. Your life isn't going to implode because you allowed yourself to be sad and emotionally vulnerable. Actually the opposite will happen, and you will allow yourself to complete the stress response cycle (link to an explanation) and move on.

It's okay to wade in your emotions. It's even okay to be completely submerged in them. You just don't want to drown in them. It is okay to fully feel every bit of the emotion as it washes over you, but you don't want it to control you. You don't want your emotions to consume you. If you lose an hour or a day here or there to your feelings. It is what it is. You just want to make sure that being sad for a day. Doesn't turn into being sad for 10 years.

Now this doesn't mean if someone passes away that you only get a week to be sad and that's that. You'll probably never stop being sad about losing that individual. However, it does not have to consume you. It's okay to move on with your life. And when you do think of that person 6 months or 6 years from now, it's okay to stop, take a deep breath, and remember that person. How it was when they were alive as well as how it hurt when they passed. It's okay to remember how much you miss them.

Turning back to positivity at some point in the near future is important, but you don't want to dismiss your emotions simply because someone said "always stay positive". It's actually healthier to let the emotions ride themselves out.

Another important note is that experiencing an emotion is not the same as how you react to it. You can fully allow anger to wash through you without screaming at someone.

Key points:



* Letting yourself emotions ride themselves out is healthier than simply forcing yourself to be positive all the time
* However, don't let yourself be consumed by your emotions for an extended period to the point it affects your general outlook on life, your relationships, or your goals.
* Feeling an emotion and experiencing it is different from how you react to it
