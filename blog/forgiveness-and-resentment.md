Letting go of grudges is incredibly important. Holding on to anger, resentment, and the grudges requires energy that is honestly a waste of your time. Being able to let go of that is very good for your mental health and your personal well-being. By harboring those negative emotions and feelings you are actually letting the person that created them win because now they're holding you down and holding you back indefinitely.

My recommendation is to forgive those wrongdoings so that you can let go of those negative emotions holding you back. At the same time you can be forgiving and you can let go of those grudges while still acknowledging that the people who did you wrong no longer deserve your time and effort. So while you may not be holding a grudge against them you can still acknowledge that you don't have to go out of your way for them, that you don't have to jump when they ask you to, and that if you decide to cut them out of your life completely or partially it doesn't mean that you have to hold on to those negative feelings you just acknowledge that this person doesn't respect you and deserve your time.

It can be a gray area to many people but there is a fine line there between holding a grudge and forgiving them while acknowledging they don't deserve you.
