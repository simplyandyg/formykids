Being able to step back from a situation that you are personally involved in and see it through the eyes of an uninvolved third party is a very important and useful skill. You want to be able to analyze your thoughts, motivations, actions, and habits to figure out why you think and do the things that you do.

(Why is this important?)

This is important because it provides you a way to hopefully catch poor judgement, faulting thinking or reasoning, and bad habits on your own before needing to be told by someone else. The important part of that is the turnaround time and not the need to spare your ego. Being told by someone else that you are wrong or that you have a bad habit is completely fine and nothing to be upset or ashamed of. However, being able to catch the errors of your ways yourself is often quicker than having to wait for someone else to spot the issue and be willing to bring it to your attention.

You should always be open to criticism, but at the same time, there is a delicate balance between bowing to what others say you should be doing and pushing on with what you think you should be doing.

Being able to step back again, helps in this situation. Say, a romantic interest does not like the job you have and really pushes you to get another because it would be higher paying. Their opinion might be right, might be wrong, or it might just fall somewhere in between. Unfortunately, many times, it can be hard to know. However, the important thing is being able to truly consider what they said may, at the very least, have some truth to it. Maybe you love your job, so you don't want to get a new one, but at the same time, maybe you really do need to be making more money. So is there a middle ground? Is there a creative way to have the best of both worlds?
