We are all on the same side.

At the end of the day, we all want what is best for this country, our friends, our family, and ourselves. We are not Democrats, Republicans, liberals, or conservatives. We are people with values, beliefs, feelings, and lives all more complex than a single label could ever explain.

“Us versus them” should not refer to average American against average American. It’s us – the average people – against them – the mega-corporations, conglomerates, lifelong politicians, and billionaires. The language they use to label us – liberal, conservative, far-left, far-right – is intentionally divisive. It’s how they keep us pointing figures at each other and not at them. Controversy sells. Unity generally doesn’t sell so well. They want their power, their clicks and views, their ad dollars, their yachts. Most of us just want a home and food for our families. Maybe to run our own local business. We don’t want to destroy lives for profits. We don’t want others to suffer so that we may gain.

The separation in this country is getting out of hand. We all need to listen better to each other. It’s okay to disagree on the path, especially when we all want the same destination. Don’t dislike your neighbor because of who they vote for, dislike the “powers that be” for providing the poor, poor choices. Don’t make assumptions about each other. Seek to understand, try to listen, and remember, we’re in this together and we all want what’s best for those around us.
