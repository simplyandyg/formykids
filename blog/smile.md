Let’s keep this short, sweet, and to the point.

Smile.

As often as you can.

It’s okay not to smile, everyone has a bad day, but physically smiling before you’re emotionally happy can actually help bring up your mood. It’s science. I’m not kidding. Look it up. The phrase, “Fake it ’til you make it” has some truth to it.

Smiling is also contagious, so you never know when your smile and good attitude might brighten someone else’s day.
