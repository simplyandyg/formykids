a series on all the things I would like Mikey to know and understand in life, especially should anything ever happen to me

For each topic, maybe I should be approaching it with the following framework:



* What is it? Why is it important? How do you do it?
* Biggest thing: given actionable points to make the advice easier to follow

What's the 1 percent?



* This is the 1 percent of the topic that the other 99% hinges on

What are the absolute most important things someone should know about life?

If you could only teach someone 5 things. What would you teach them?



1. Sleep, exercise, diet
2. Be open and vulnerable, but don't get walked on. Limit the numbers of times a single person can screw you over.
3. Active Listening
4. Take time to do things you enjoy no matter how "busy" you are. - leading into Essentialism. Strip away the things that are not important to you or your goals.
5. Do the right thing
6. Why doing the right thing can so often have difficult or hurtful consequences - why making people upset doesn’t mean you necessarily did the wrong thing - why often you can try to become a better person and it feels impossible because things keep going wrong and how to deal with it
7. How to focus and really get things done and how hard work doesn't need to mean working all the time, but rather working hard during the allotted time
8. Never let yourself live in fear - give lots of examples - fear of making people angry, fear your spouse will be upset with you, fear of failure, do not let fear rule your life
9. How to balance perfection with production
10. Meditate or at least time for your mind to relax and to wander. No screens, no music (unless calming), no input. Let yourself be calm and bored. Give your mind time to relax, especially in today's world
11. Plan and be spontaneous at the same time
12. Growth mindset
13. Open-mindedness
14. Meta-cognition (thinking about how you think) and what mental models are, not necessarily any specific ones but just the concept
15. Write to think deeply. Thinking a lot about something is not the same as thinking deeply. Thinking about something "a lot" doesn't mean a couple minutes here and there with only surface level thoughts. Work through the garbage to get to the good stuff. What questions to ask? Which decisions warrant deep thought?
16. Don't be mentally lazy. We often over estimate the amount of effort and time required to complete relatively simple tasks while underestimating large ones (e.g. entire projects)
17. Knowledge depth vs. Surface knowledge. Surface knowledge is something anyone can learn with a quick Google search. And today's world where the internet is everywhere surface knowledge is becoming less and less useful. Deep knowledge however is becoming more and more important and valuable. As is being able to make connections and insights across fields or disciplines often thanks to the deep knowledge one holds.
18. Compounding
19. Beginner's mind
20. Deliberate practice
21. Thirst for knowledge and a love of learning. Learn deeply on what interests you, the hell with whether or not someone thinks it is useful. There are very few subjects where a deep knowledge of it is useless and holds no value.
22. How to be smarter?
23. How to develop habits
24. Strategic thinking?
25. Thinking outside the box
26. The law of averages - you don’t have to be exceptional every day, but if you are most days then you’re okay. You don’t have to have perfect sleep every night but if you do most nights, you’re doing good.

**People**



* Family
* Friends
* Love
* Listening
    * Responding instead of reacting
    * Listen and internalize
* Smile
* People are who they are, not who you want them to be

**Morality**



* Doing the right thing
* Being Honest
* F*ck talking sh*t
    * Does the current post include don't judge other people?

**Health**



* Sleep and recovery
* Exercise
* Diet
* Meditate
* Make time for play
* Don't hold it in or harbor resentment

**Growth (break this into growth and ‘How to Think’ and maybe more)**



* Growth Mindset
    * [https://twitter.com/schoolforgot/status/1385567467955752961?s=19](https://twitter.com/schoolforgot/status/1385567467955752961?s=19)
* Being open minded
* Thinking "a lot" is not the same as thinking deeply with singular focus
* "Keep digging" to find the best quality work you can produce
    * Write and then write and then write some more and then keep writing. This way you get all the garbage material out and then suddenly the great stuff will start flowing out (find who wrote the quote similar to this)
    * This quote translates to just about every other creative endeavors. Keep pushing, keep spewing our your ideas over and over until you hit the good ones
* Hard Work
    * Being smart isn't enough - I grew up believing it was because I was always told it was great I was so smart. That led me to believe if I didn't get something at first, I should just move on because I just wouldn't get it. I was so smart so it must not be my thing otherwise I'd get it. Also believed I should be paid well and succeed just for being smart.
    * Some people say “work smart” don’t “work hard”. They generally mean, use your head more and you can use your time less while still making the same if not more money
    * In my experience the “work smart” part really means, use your head to think in-depth about what you are doing. It is the in-depth thought in conjunction with action that makes the difference. You don’t want to be paralyzed by your thought, but if you are simply acting without reflection and deep, focused thought on the subject then I believe you end up in the “works hard but doesn’t get ahead” category. Keep in mind that “getting ahead” is subjective. And one person's success is not the same as another.
* Hacks, Quacks, and Bullshit
    * 5 minute fixes or get fit in a week and similar things are bullshit. Don't waste your time. Don't try to rush things
* Compounding (like interest)
    * Establishing routines
    * My daily routines
* Beginner's mind
* Education / learning / continual learning / thirst for knowledge
    * Slowing down to speed up
        * This applies to learning, sports, lifting, running, etc.
        * Slow is smooth and smooth is fast
    * How to be smarter
    * The difference between understanding and knowing/mastery
    * Don’t be a Cultist
        * Don’t allow yourself to be blinded by your admiration, love, friendship, etc
        * Do not blindly believe all the information you get from any one person or source
        * I’m applying this more to informational trust than to personal trust
        * Take everything you hear with a grain of salt, no one source is always right and unbiased
* Reading the source is important
    * Reading cliff notes or shortened versions of books is faster but not better (books are not the only source… sometimes it's a long well written blog post, podcast, etc)
    * It doesn't provide the reiteration of important ideas that happen in books and leads to those ideas sticking in your mind
    * Unless you have a really good system in place for learning
    * But even still, I think the source is important
* History repeating and society ignoring it
* Failure isn't failing - not learning from it is
* How to be smarter
* Deliberate Practice
* Value and Goal Setting
    * OKRs
* Productivity
* Focus
    * Define focus
    * What is it? Why is it important? How do you do it?
* Balancing focus and exploration/learning
* Prioritizing
    * 99% of the time people say "I don't have time", it means I don't want to do it and I don't want to make the time
* Mental models
    * Inversion - flip the way you're thinking about something
* Habits
* First Principles
    * [https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1371140133622222851?s=20](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1371140133622222851?s=20)
    * Socratic questioning
* Strategic thinking
    * Discuss the definition of this that has to do with overarching strategy and planning such as goal setting etc
    * Discuss the kind of thinking one can use to come up with a plan for how to succeed in the face of their failures.
    * For example if you continue to fail to develop a specific habit what can you do to make it work instead of just accepting that it won't? Ask yourself the following question: What would you tell someone else if they came to you for advice?
    * Oftentimes we have great advice inside of us but we are not good at expressing that advice to ourself and we are also generally not good at following that advice. However it is good to have techniques to be able to pull that advice out of us so that we can at least try to follow it.
    * Example: I am having trouble focusing on my goals. No matter what I do I just can't seem to get anywhere. There's always so much going on. So what would I tell someone else who is having this problem? I would probably say well where does your time go? Could you write down all the things you do in a day and not off the top of your head but rather as you do them. Are you looking at your phone 40 times an hour? Are you googling random things when you should be writing? How much time do you spend watching TV? How much time do you spend doing something else that maybe of little to no value especially when it comes to achieving your goals.
* Goal setting
    * Even if you don't want to improve and just want to live in the moment and enjoy life, setting goals can help clarify what you do want in life and how to avoid the things that will bring you down
* Sales
* Don’t fall into all or nothing thinking

**Creativity**



* Following your own path
* Thinking outside the box
* Don't be afraid to express your weird ideas
* Bending the rules
* Not always following the rules
* Rules were created by someone no smarter than you
* Asking questions and questioning the status quo
* Not being afraid to stand out and forge your own path
* It's okay if your "original" thoughts aren't so original
    * It's not always so much about the thought as how you came to the conclusion and recognizing the critical thinking that went into it.
    * Just because something is "unoriginal" doesn't mean it is not important and that everyone knows and understands it.
* Play

**Emotion**



* Empathy and Compassion
* Forgiveness vs. Holding a Grudge
* Staying calm and emotional control
    * [https://valerad.medium.com/the-anger-5d6e72773a18](https://valerad.medium.com/the-anger-5d6e72773a18)
* Stepping back / taking yourself out of a situation / seeing it from an outside perspective
* Imposter syndrome
    * Feeling insecure is fine and normal
* What if happiness is habit based?
    * We are stuck on the idea that we need multiple hours per day to sit in the couch and watch TV or post video games or spend hours on YouTube and our phones.
    * Yet somehow we "don't have time" for things like meditation, stretching, exercise, etc that are good for our mind and body
* Happiness
    * How do habits affect this?
    * [https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19](https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19)
* Learn to be introspective
    * So you can avoid lying to yourself - often if you are lying to yourself, it's not only affecting you - lying to yourself by making false gestures of kindness towards people (offering way after you know they'll say no) to make yourself feel good about not helping them out - or lying to yourself about an addiction
* Dependence and codependence
* Writing to remove "random" frustration
    * Sometimes we are in a bad mood and don't know why. Writing how and what we are feeling can help bring out the "why"
* It's Okay to Be Emotional (Emotions are not the Enemy)

**Nature**



* The importance and fragility of the environment and ecosystems
* A natural world untouched by man - what the physical world looks like when not paved over and built on

**Psychology**



* The mental boundaries we put on ourselves
    * Example: when you don't have kids, the feeling that you NEED to be home for you spouse even if you only go out once a week
* Motivation
* Habit Building
* Confirmation bias
* Incentives
* Bias and interpretation of the world
* Sunk cost fallacy
* Empathy deep dive
    * In depth explanation on how hard it is to judge others, we make mistakes too, we get tunnel vision, it can last seconds or years, we don't always make decisions or say things inline with our core values, I've said things and forgotten to later be told about them and it surprised me
    * Instead of saying things like "no one would ever think that way" or "no one would ever do that", we should think and say "what could cause a reasonable person to act that way" and give others the benefit of the doubt, at least the first couple of times
* Conspiracy theories and why people believe “crazy” things even if they aren’t “crazy”
* People rarely act with intention
    * Mostly act on instinct, emotion, and reaction
    * Not a well thought it plan
    * I doubt most abusive behavior is based on a week thought out plan - such as someone sitting down and planning out how to cut someone off from their family
    * Instead it is probably based on reaction after reaction due to jealous feelings instead of a grand sinister master plan
    * Probably think of a less sensitive example for the article

**Personal Finance**



* Budgeting
* Taxes
* Interest
* Credit Rating
* Credit Cards
* Loans
* Investing
* When all else fails, cut a deal (in hot water, heading to collections, or in collections? Tell them what you could comfortably pay, but that's all you can do, otherwise they can chase you)
* Need vs. Want - $1300 phone vs organic food

**Communication**



* Being clear (and concise)
* You don't owe most people an explanation

**Negotiating**



* Buying large items
* Buying a house
* Buying a car

**Zen**



* Gratitude
    * [https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19](https://twitter.com/simplyandyg/status/1385979713752031232?s=19)
* Materialism
* Balance vs. Extremism
* Circle of life / how many of these principles are interdependent and intertwined
* Meditation
* 5-second memory, taking things at face value and avoiding assumptions (when taking & arguing with people)

**Misc**



* Avoiding information overload
* Time is the most important currency
    * Would you take $100 billion dollars if it meant you had to be 90 years old?
    * [https://twitter.com/Camp4/status/1346542428946239488?s=20](https://twitter.com/Camp4/status/1346542428946239488?s=20)
* Surface level knowledge is a waste of your time

**The way the world truly operates**



* Greed
* Big industries
* Conglomerates
* Big money politics
* Oligarchy vs democracy vs republic
* Media creating polarized opinions, pitting the every day people against each other
* Issues with capitalism, either we have a poor implementation with stocks etc or it is a fundamentally flawed economic system
* Consumerism/materialism - and how society is built around them instead of the common good/altruism. For thousands of years, society has been built on a class based system. Modern day problems that are for the common good or to help us in the future often have a very hard time getting funding and/or research because there is not direct or current or near future commercially viable product/service tied to it
* Don't underestimate the power of convenience. People will trade a whole lot to make things more convenient in the "now"
* Most people are average… and that's a good thing
    * Talk about the bell curve and how most people fall in the middle. Explicitly state what percentage of people fall within ex sigma. Then describe how the reason that's good is for things like politics and the way people act. And how this all applies to show that the crazy opinions and the crazy people we see in media and on the internet and going viral do not represent the vast majority of us. And the vast majority of us just want what we think is best we don't want to be bothered with other people's lives we just want to do what we want to do.

This was a topic that was under morality… not sure what I meant by it or where it should be

How to Read People???

**Gratefulness Challenge**

This would be a 1-7 (or more I guess) day challenge where every time you get mad, you write why you're actually grateful for the thing that made you angry

Examples:

Mad you can't find your car keys - grateful you have enough stuff that you can lose your car keys, grateful you have a car at all

Your spouse left a mess on the counter - grateful your spouse is a generally awesome person to be around, grateful you have a roof over your head

You don't get the promotion at work - grateful that you have a job at all

The idea here was that I would post this to everythingschoolforgot.com and my twitter
